# Incident disclosure - 2023-05-21

## Summary
- Yearn's yVault staking zap on Optimism did not properly handle an edge case when a user deposit brings the vault's total assets above its set `depositLimit`.
- As a result, only the allowable portion of the deposit was successfully zapped, while excess funds remained in the zap contract.
- Once space in the vault opened up for another user to deposit, the next user to zap in received their own expected USDT as well as any pre-existing USDT balance from affected prior zaps. This sequence occurred twice.
- One user benefitted ~$20k, another lost ~$21k, and a third had a net gain of $1k from a loss and gain (and reported the bug). The user whose funds were stuck has been made whole, and the user who reported the issue has been awarded a bug bounty.
- In response, Yearn has deployed a new zap that properly handles the edge case. Additionally, deposit limits on vaults have been raised to accommodate additional deposits.
- Yearn will continue distribution of our OP grant uninterrupted, with over $1 million in rewards remaining.

## Background
- As a part of Yearn's expansion to Optimism, a grant was received for 1m $OP from the Optimism Foundation, to be distributed to protocol users over the course of a year. To facilitate staking of vault tokens for rewards in one step, Yearn deployed a zap contract [[1]](#References).
- The `StakingRewardsZap` accepts a vault's underlying token, deposits to the chosen vault, and stakes in Yearn's yVault staking contract on Optimism on behalf of the user.
- The zap expects to deposit all of the tokens it receives, and then stake the vault tokens for the user in the staking contract.

## Details of Incident
- In this case, the yvUSDT vault had a low ($1m) deposit limit. Thus, even though the zap tried to deposit all of the USDT it held for the user, it hit the deposit limit.
- Normally, the vault would enforce that the user receives the appropriate shares for the amount desired to deposit. However, the zap used `deposit()` which deposits the user's full balance **or** the remaining space up to the deposit limit (whichever is lower), and *does not* revert based on how much is ultimately deposited.
- Thus, a combination of using the `deposit()` function, in conjunction with the deposit limit being hit meant that a user zapping in would not receive the appropriate amount of yvUSDT credited to their account, with the excess USDT remaining in the zap contract.

## Details of Fix
### Short-term fix
- The deposit limit on yvUSDT was raised to $10m [[2]](#References). As this bug only occurred when the deposit limit was reached, this allowed time to deploy a new zap with a permanent fix.

### Long-term fix
- Zap PR with diff to old zap [[3]](#References)
- This updated zap [[4]](#References) more explicitly tracks the amount zapped, enforces expected behavior with a `require()` statement, and also uses `vault.deposit(uint256)`, which contains another check [[5]](#References) at the vault level to ensure a zap user receives the shares they expect.
